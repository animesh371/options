# Slash Options

Overall Winner of Barclays' 2015 "Heroes vs. Hackers" Hackathon. 

## Description

__Slash Options__ is a marketplace for peer-to-peer decentralized option contract trading. 

The platform allows users to freely bid or ask for Bitcoin options without the need for a middleman. 

Once a contract is accepted by both parties, a smart contract containing a digital equivalent of the option's collateral is permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain. 

The smart contract automatically executes and dispersed funds when the terms of the option are met.

## Background

This project was developed in less than 36 hours during Barclays' "Heroes vs. Hackers" Hackathon with the goal of applying blockchain technology to financial services. 

## Features

+ Leverages the Ethereum protocol & Solidity to create smart option contracts.
+ Uses BlockApps' STRATO platform and the [BlockApps JavaScript API](https://github.com/blockapps/blockapps-js) to interface with the Ethereum blockchain. 
+ Built with a Ruby on Rails back-end to support the platform and improve the user experience. 

## Future

We will continue to develop __Slash Options__ with the support of Barclays and Rise New York.
